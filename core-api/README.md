# Hazelcast Jet Core-API Code Samples

Code samples for Hazelcast Jet using the DAG API.

## [Enrichment](enrichment-core-api/src/main/java)

This sample shows, how to enrich items with additional
information by matching them by key

## [Stock Exchange Simulation](stock-exchange/src/main/java)

Two samples that demonstrate sliding window aggregation in a
single-stage and in a two-stage setup.

## [Custom File Sink](map-dump/src/main/java)   

Shows how to implement a custom distributed sink that stores the
data in files.
	
## [Prime Number Finder](prime-finder/src/main/java)

Shows how to implement a custom distributed source, including custom
partitioning at the source using the `ProcessorMetaSupplier` API.
The sample implements a distributed generator of integers which is 
used as the source for a filtering vertex that selects the prime
numbers from it.
	
## [Inverted Index with TF-IDF Scoring](tf-idf/src/main/java) 

Demonstrates the power of the Core API by building a hand-optimized
DAG that cannot be reproduced with the higher-level APIs. The sample
builds an _inverted index_ on a corpus of about a 100 MB of book
material and then presents you with a GUI dialog where you can enter 
your search terms. The GUI poignantly demonstrates the speed of the
search by instantly responding to every keystroke and displaying a
result list.
	
## [Word Count](wordcount-core-api/src/main/java)

The classical Word Count task implemented in the Core API.
