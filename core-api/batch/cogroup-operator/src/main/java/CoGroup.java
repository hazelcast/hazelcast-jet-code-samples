/**
 * A sample demonstrating implementation of CoGroup processor. The processor
 * does a full outer join on two sources by a given key demonstrating a
 * many-to-many relationship.
 * <p>
 * Each student is enrolled to one more or courses, and each teacher is
 * assigned to a course. A course can have many teachers. The expected
 * output is all pairs of teachers and students where they
 * share the same course.
 * <p>
 * Also see comments in {@link CoGroupP}.
